<h3>CSS Quick Tips</h3>
    <h4>Master Visualization in CSS</h4>
    <p>1. Create a design file. Have a CSS file that is not linked to your HTML file where you 
        store your most used colors, fonts, etc. for easy access and better organization.
    <br><br>
        2. Create a universal CSS file. Universal CSS files may be helpful when you have a larger site spread across 
        multiple HTML pages. The universal CSS file can hold design principles which will be applied accross all HTML pages 
        for more cohesive design. Be sure to link both the universal CSS file and the specific CSS stylesheet to each HTML page.

<h3>HTML Do's and Dont's</h3>

    <div class="section">

        <h4>Take your HTML from beginner to intermediate with these tips</h4>

        <p>1. Start with the basics. You should start your HTML file using the standard H1 through H6 headings and other
            predesignated HTML structural elements. This will help reduce overcrowding of classes and IDs. This also aids in web browser crawling, 
            which is when the web browsers filter through your HTML sheet and look for relevant information to present upon query searches. 
        <br><br>
            2. Create classes that are widely useable. The idea of classes is that they apply to more than one instance of an element. By creating classes that 
            are widely used you will inevitably create a more cohesive style amongst your site.

<h3>Binary Basics</h3>

    <div class="section">

        <h4>Binary, the genetics of the CPU</h4>
        <p>Binary can seem overwhelming and confusing. I like to think of binary as the genetic code 
            of the CPU. Just like strands of DNA, different encoding in binary result in different outcomes. 
            All of the instructions (your written programs and already written instructions) are fed to the CPU 
            in binary form via a machine program written by the assembler.

        <br><br>
            Binary is important in your personal coding practice as 
        </p>

<h3>Understanding Logic (The easy way)</h3>

    <div class="section">

        <h4>You use logic everyday, let's make it simpler</h4>
            <p class="text">There are four main logic operators. 
                <br>
                <ul id="logic-list">
                <li>AND &</li>
                <li>XOR ^</li>
                <li>OR |</li>
                <li>NOT ~</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The symbols used for these operators may vary in text, but in coding practice these 
                four symbols are what you will use to code logic.
            <br><br>
            Let's think about logic in the form of a search engine.
            <br><br>
            </p>

            <p class="bolded">AND - Two truths make a truth.</p>
                <div class="sub-text">
                    ex: If your search asks for something to be blue AND round the only results which would return true
                    must be both blue AND round. If an item is blue but NOT round, this would be false.
                <br><br>
                    In binary terms: if we were to do 1100 & (AND) 0101 our result would be 0100.
                </div>
        
            <p class="bolded">XOR - A truth and a lie makes a truth.</p>
                <div class="sub-text">
                    ex: If your search asks for something to be blue XOR round the only true results which would return true 
                    must be either blue OR round. Search results that are both blue AND round would return false for XOR.
                <br><br>
                    In binary terms: if we were to do 1100 ^ 0101 our result would be 1001.
                </div>

            <p class="bolded">OR - A truth and a lie or a truth and a truth makes a truth.</p>
                <div class="sub-text">
                    ex: If your search asks for someting to be blue OR round the results which would return true would be items which are 
                    blue and round, or just blue, or just round.
                <br><br>
                    In binary terms: if we were to do 1100 | 0101 our result would be 1101.
                </div>

            <p class="bolded">NOT - Only what is not true makes a truth.</p>
                <div class="sub-text">
                    ex: If you search asks for something to be NOT blue the only results which would return true would be items which are NOT blue.
                    <br><br>
                    In binary terms: if we were to do ~1100 our result would be 0011.
                </div>
